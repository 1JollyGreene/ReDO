ETL Exercise
The ETL will extract and transform the data located in the ETLLegacyDBData text file and the ETLManualData csv file. The transforming process standardizes all formats 
and organizes the data into designed columns. There is an error log that is also exported once the transforming process is completed in order to log all changes that were made.
The transform process also involves combining data from both files into one for a more convenient upload.
